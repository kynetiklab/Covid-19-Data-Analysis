Title: COVID-19 Data Analysis

Description:
This repository contains a data analysis project on the COVID-19 pandemic. The project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data sourced from "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/". It includes data scraping, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The project provides insights into the spread of COVID-19, including trends, patterns, and key metrics at the global level. It showcases the use of data analysis techniques to extract meaningful information from the dataset and presents the findings through visualizations, such as line charts, bar plots, and heatmaps.

The repository also includes a Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations of the data analysis process, code snippets, and visualizations. The project emphasizes accuracy in data handling and analysis, ensuring reliable and precise results.

This COVID-19 data analysis project serves as a demonstration of my skills in data manipulation, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques. It showcases my ability to extract valuable insights from large datasets and present them in a clear and informative manner.

Feel free to explore the repository and leverage the code and visualizations for reference or further analysis. For any inquiries or collaborations, please don't hesitate to contact me.
